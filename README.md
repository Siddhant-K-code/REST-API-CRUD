# REST API CRUD

It is the basic Project, where i am learning about REST API, its basic working will be Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) of User Data (Username, Name, Age).

You Can Use this By Following Methods:

- Clone/ Download
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- `user.json` contains data, soon, i will update it, to automatic update, delete ..

I uses Postman to GET, POST API and other testing.
